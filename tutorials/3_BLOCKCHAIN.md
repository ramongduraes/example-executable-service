# Blockchain, Metamask

TODO

> Might be merged with "Identity"

Briefly mention users interaction with the blockchain, mostly to explain why SNET's identity is simply a local alias for the private key (to make life easier when signing transactions and switching identities.)

Mention Kovan is a test network where everything is free.

## Metamask

Install Metamask extension for Google Chrome 
Create an account, go to kovan, get the private key
